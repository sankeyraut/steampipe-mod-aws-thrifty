# Thrifty Cost Explorer Benchmark

Thrifty developers actively monitor their cloud usage and cost data.  This benchmark highlights service charges that have changed drastically over the last two full months of cost data.  Change line 51 of the named query (monthly_service_cost_changes.sql) to adjust the granularity of the alarm.

## Default Thresholds
- [ Monthly cost change threshold (10 cost units e.g. USD)](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-aws-thrifty/blob/1f71e77023825835770fd88d70e745c8379c68a5/query/monthly_service_cost_changes.sql#L51)

## Help wanted
- check current forcast against last full month for escallating cost.
